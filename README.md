# Kerbal Wind Tunnel Unofficial

A mod for Kerbal Space Program to provide atmospheric performance data for spaceplanes and aircraft.

**ATTENTION** The upstream is under active development. If you don't really need any of my changes, IMHO it's better to stick with the original version! :)

## Description

In the real world of aircraft design, engineers calculate the flight envelope for their aircraft before the first test flight rolls out.

This mod runs your spaceplane through a virtual wind tunnel while still in the SPH and predicts its engine and flight performance at every speed and altitude.


## Installation

In your KSP GameData folder, delete any existing `WindTunnel` folder. Download the zip file to your KSP GameData folder and unzip.ï»¿
